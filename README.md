# n00t

n00t is an OSS-first, MCP-centric agent control centre that:
- scans a project for MCP servers, CLIs, OpenAPI/GraphQL specs;
- normalises them into a capability graph;
- exposes them to an agent (local or cloud) via a unified host; and
- ships a drop-in web UI (Next.js) to chat with and orchestrate capabilities.

This is a starter pack scaffold, not a production build.
