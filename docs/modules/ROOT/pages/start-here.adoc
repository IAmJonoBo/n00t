Need the original onboarding guide? The legacy Markdown lives at
`n00t/START HERE/README.md` inside this repository. Use the link below to open it
from the rendered site while we continue migrating its content into Antora:

As migrations land, this page will be replaced with native AsciiDoc that mirrors
the same structure (capabilities overview, MCP wiring, credential bundles, and
handover checklists).
